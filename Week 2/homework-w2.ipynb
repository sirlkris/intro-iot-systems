In this task, you will get the *direct solar radiation* with 1 minute time interval from the *Radiation observations*  at [FMI](http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/download-observations#!/). Plot radiation profile of three different days so that one must be in March, other in July and the last in December (regardless of the year). Provide *information* about the potential of solar generation in those days. You can also select the measuring station (but write it in the answer).**\n\n*Hint:* Code like in the tutorial notebook."
