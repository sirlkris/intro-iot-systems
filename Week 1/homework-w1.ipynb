This makes the heater to consume more eletricity. If the air is warmer/close to the desired temerature, time that the heater has to be on reduces. At the same time eletricity comsumption is reduced. By chaning control type of the heater, the heater can be changet to output constant heat, so it doesnt follow air tempertautre thus consuming constant eletrical energy."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.7.8","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
